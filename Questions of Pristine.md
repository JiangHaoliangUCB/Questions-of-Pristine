# Questions of Pristine

- I see that you can create a new project by running `pristine-cli myNewProject`. I wonder what other functions can pristine-cli serve. It is a command line interface, so it should be able to execute a lot of different commands. What else can it do beside opening up a new project?
- What command am I supposed to type in in order to apply the Pristine templates to an existing repo. For example, I have already created a remote repo with some existing codes in js files and a poorly written ReadMe.md file, how shall I re-apply the Pristine template and overwrite my poorly written ReadMe.md?
- What is original condition of a repository? And why is Pristine based on it?
- What is the major advantage of Document Driven Development Approach? Is there any other development approach? How do they compare?
- A question related to GitHub: what is the difference between forking a repo and cloning a repo?
